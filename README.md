# Optimization of Wavelet Functions with Genetic Algorithms in Matlab
Matlab Files to optimize a wavelet function using genetic algorithms (GA) and lifting schemes (LS), which are an implementation of the WT using filter banks. The LS have two FIR filter, U and P, that correspond to the wavelet and scalling functions in the traditional WT. The GA optimize U and P based on a given cost function, for example, class separability, mutual information, etc. This method has been presented among other references in [1,2]. The library implementing the GA is from Peter MÃ¸ller-Nielsen  http://www.daimi.au.dk/~pmn/Matlab/dochome/toolbox/GAOT/gaotindex.html
